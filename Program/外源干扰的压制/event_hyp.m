function amat=event_hyp(amat,t,x,tnot,xnot,v,amp,flag,aper)
% EVENT_HYP: inserts a hyperbolic event in a matrix.
%
% amat=event_hyp(amat,t,x,tnot,xnot,v,amp,flag,aper)
%
% EVENT_HYP inserts a hyperbolic event in a matrix.
%
% amat ... the matrix of size nrows by ncols
% t ... vector of length nrows giving the matrix t coordinates
% x ... vector of length ncols giving the matrix x coordinates
% tnot ... t coordinate of the hyperbola apex
% xnot ... x coordinate of the hyperbola apex
% v ... velocity of hyperbola. Value is divided by two to simulate post
%       stack. If you are doing prestack, double your velocity.
% amp ... amplitude at the apex
% flag ... determines amplitude decay on hyperbola
%		1 -> no decay
%		2 -> decay as to/tx (obliquity)
%     3 -> decay as to/(tx^1.5) (2D)
%		4 -> decay as to/(tx^2) (3D)
% ******** default is 3 ********
% aper ... truncate hyperbola beyond this aperture
% ******** default is no truncation ********
